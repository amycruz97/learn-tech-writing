# A Self-Study Plan to Learn Tech Writing

If you want to become a tech writer, you need to write tech docs! However, it's difficult to figure out how to get started, what you need to learn, and what resources to use. So I put together this project-based self-study plan to help you: 

- Learn what's tech writing and the tech writing process
- Learn the common tech documents in the software industry (UI docs, user docs, developer docs)(documentation framework)
- Familiarize yourself with industry-standard style guides
- Create 4 tech writing samples for your portfolio
- Use GitHub and Markdown

**Estimated time required: 4 weeks (1-2 hours per day)**

If you are a curious about tech writing as a career or a new tech writer, this plan is for you. 

### Who am I?

I am Amruta Ranade, the Staff Tech Writer at a distributed database startup in New York City. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and a Master's degree in Technical Communication. And I [make YouTube videos about tech writing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKsaZMjb3lsLe5YtasDifuA). 

Now that introductions are out of the way, let's get to the plan!

## Week 1: What is Tech Writing + Beginner FAQs + Tech Writing Process + Introduction to GitHub

**Day 1: Go through beginner resources** 

Resource Type | Resource 
:-- | :--
Video | [What do Technical Writers do? (Also, What is Technical Writing](https://youtu.be/biocrCx5T_k) 
Video | [Advice for Technical Writing Beginners](https://youtu.be/JHm3kVMITmI)  
Reddit thread | [Read this before asking about salaries, what education you need, or how to start a technical writing career](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/bomlrj/read_this_before_asking_about_salaries_what/)
Video | [[Updated] Day in my Life as a Tech Writer](https://youtu.be/8AbBf3j0hSY)

**Day 2: Complete Google's "Technical Writing One" course**

In 2015, Google developed two technical writing courses for their engineers. The courses are now available for anyone who wants to learn technical writing. 

Complete the [first course ("Technical Writing One")](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one) that teaches the fundamentals of technical writing. 

**Day 3: Learn how to write a technical document**

Watch the "How to write a technical document" series on my YouTube channel. 

- [Prewriting + Working with Subject Matter Experts](https://youtu.be/urOLNxRm2KM) 
- [Audience Analysis Worksheet](https://youtu.be/TXisTiNAWyE)  
- [Writing the First Draft](https://youtu.be/MHOH2kgXfDc)
- [Technical Editing Checklist](https://youtu.be/vpl8WaXnmMs)

I know it's a lot of information but you don't have to retain all of it. You will have opportunities to revisit and practice the techniques as you work through the self-study plan.

**Day 4: Complete Google's "Technical Writing Two" course**

Complete the [second course offered by Google ("Technical Writing Two")](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two) that builds on the first course.

**Day 5: Learn about Divio's documentation system

One of my favorite tech writing resources is [Divio's documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/). I recommend carefully studying all the sections of the system to develop helpful mental models for your technical documents.

**Days 6: Learn how to learn new tech**

So far, we have discussed the writing side of tech writing. Now it's time to discuss the most important skill for a tech writer -- learning how to learn new tech.

To start with, watch the [5 ways to learn tech](https://youtu.be/GtjcxfO_bKI) video.

Now comes the slightly daunting step: Learning Git and GitHub. Here's why I think tech writers should learn GitHub:

- GitHub is an excellent tool to have in your tech writing toolkit. Having GitHub on your resume signals that you are comfortable learning and using technological products.
- Although GitHub is a technically complex tool, there are literally millions of resources available to learn how to use GitHub. And as a new tech writer, you don't need to get into the complex functionality right away. You can accomplish a lot with the Desktop/browser version.
- It is an excellent collaboration and project management tool ("Issues" and "Projects Boards")
- It opens up the world of open source software

To get started with GitHub:
- Watch "What is Git - A Quick Introduction to the Git Version Control System": https://youtu.be/OqmSzXDrJBk
- Watch "What is Git and GitHub?": https://youtu.be/uUuTYDg9XoI
- Watch the "What is GitHub?" video: https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E
- Complete the "Hello, World" tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
- Read the "Understanding the GitHub Flow" guide: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

**Day 7: Rest and Reflect** 

Now that you have a basic understanding of the field, it's time to self-evaluate. Complete the "Is technical writing the right career for you" worksheet.

## Week 2: Writing a tutorial + Introduction to Style Guides

**Day 8: Make your first GitHub contribution**

- Take the "Introduction to GitHub" free course: https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github
- Make your first contribution: https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions

This step can be a bit daunting, so take your time with it. Also make a note of how you feel as you work through the course and your first contribution. Do you feel excited, anxious, or dreadful? This can be a very good indication of your comfort with learning new tech. A little apprehension when encountering a new piece of technology is expected, and that's something you'll have to deal with quite routinely as a tech writer. What matters is not letting the apprehension stop you -- look for more resources, google terms you are unfamiliar with, ask informed questions after you have done your self-study. 

**Day 9: Figure out the procedure to create a pull request using the GitHub UI and outline a tutorial for the procedure**

The procedure you followed on Day 8 was to create a pull request using the command line. Now figure out how you'd have made the pull request using the GitHub in-browser UI instead. Remember, Google's your friend. 

Once you figure out the procedure, outline a tutorial for new contributors to make their first pull request to the [First Contributions repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) using the GitHub UI instead of the command line.

**Day 10: Audience Analysis**

Complete the [Audience Analysis worksheet](https://youtu.be/TXisTiNAWyE) for the tutorial you outlined on Day 9. 
Based on your answers, [write the first draft](https://youtu.be/MHOH2kgXfDc) for the tutorial.
If you need a refresher on what's a tutorial, refer to [Divio's article on the topic](https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/).

**Day 11 and 12: Study the Microsoft Style Guide:**

[Style Guides](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/style-guides/) help tech writers make consistent writing choices across documents. For new tech writers, I recommend starting with the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). 

On Days 11 and 12, go through the following subsections of the Microsoft Writing Style Guide:

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human)

## Week 3: Writing how-to guides and reference documents

**Day 15: Draft a how-to guide to create a pull request**

If you need a refresher on the difference between a tutorial and a how-to guide, [read Divio's article on the topic](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/).

As the article states, how-to guides "assume some knowledge and understanding". For this activity, you can assume that the reader has already followed the tutorial to create a pull request to the First Contributors repository. Now write a how-to guide to help them make a pull request to *any* repository. 

**Day 16: Study the DigitalOcean and Google style guides:** 

Let's expand our repertoire of style guides. Study the following style guides:

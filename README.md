# A Self-Study Plan to Learn Tech Writing

If you want to become a tech writer, you need to write tech docs! However, I know it's difficult to figure out how to get started, what you need to learn, and what resources to use. So I created this project-based self-study plan to help you: 

- Learn what's tech writing and the tech writing process
- Learn the common tech documents in the software industry (UI docs, user docs, developer docs)(documentation framework)
- Familiarize yourself with industry-standard style guides
- Create 4 tech writing samples for your portfolio
- Use GitHub and Markdown

Estimated time required: 4 weeks (1-2 hours per day)

If you are a curious about tech writing as a career or a new tech writer, this plan is for you. 

### Who am I?

I am Amruta Ranade, the Staff Tech Writer at a distributed database startup in New York City. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and a Master's degree in Technical Communication. And I [make YouTube videos about tech writing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKsaZMjb3lsLe5YtasDifuA). 

Now that introductions are out of the way, let's get to the plan!

## Week 1: Learn the basics

**Day 1: Go through beginner resources** 

Resource Type | Resource 
:-- | :--
Video | [What do Technical Writers do? (Also, What is Technical Writing](https://youtu.be/biocrCx5T_k) 
Video | [Advice for Technical Writing Beginners](https://youtu.be/JHm3kVMITmI)  
Reddit thread | [Read this before asking about salaries, what education you need, or how to start a technical writing career](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/bomlrj/read_this_before_asking_about_salaries_what/)
Video | [[Updated] Day in my Life as a Tech Writer](https://youtu.be/8AbBf3j0hSY)

**Day 2: Complete Google's "Technical Writing One" course**

In 2015, Google developed two technical writing courses for their engineers. The courses are now available for anyone who wants to learn technical writing. 

Complete the [first course ("Technical Writing One")](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one) that teaches the fundamentals of technical writing. 

**Day 3: Learn how to write a technical document**

Watch the "How to write a technical document" series on my YouTube channel. 

Resource Type | Resource 
:-- | :--
Video | [Prewriting + Working with Subject Matter Experts](https://youtu.be/urOLNxRm2KM) 
Video | [Audience Analysis Worksheet](https://youtu.be/TXisTiNAWyE)  
Video | [Writing the First Draft](https://youtu.be/MHOH2kgXfDc)
Video | [Technical Editing Checklist](https://youtu.be/vpl8WaXnmMs)

I know it's a lot of information but you don't have to retain all of it. You will have opportunities to revisit and practice the techniques as you work through the self-study plan.

**Day 4: Complete Google's "Technical Writing Two" course**

Complete the [second course offered by Google ("Technical Writing Two")](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two) focuses on intermediate topics.

**Days 5 and 6: Learn how to learn new tech**

So far, we have discussed the writing side of tech writing. Now it's time to learn the most important skill for a tech writer -- learning how to learn new tech.

To start with, watch the [5 ways to learn tech](https://youtu.be/GtjcxfO_bKI) video.

Now comes the slightly daunting step: Learning Git and GitHub. Here's why I think tech writers should learn GitHub:

- GitHub is an excellent tool to have in your tech writing toolkit. Having GitHub on your resume signals that you are comfortable learning and using technological products.
- Although GitHub is a technically complex tool, there are literally millions of resources available to learn how to use GitHub. And as a new tech writer, you don't need to get into the complex functionality right away. You can accomplish a lot with the Desktop/browser version.
- It is an excellent collaboration and project management tool ("Issues" and "Projects Boards")
- It opens up the world of open source software

To get started with GitHub:
- Watch "What is Git - A Quick Introduction to the Git Version Control System": https://youtu.be/OqmSzXDrJBk
- Watch "What is Git and GitHub?": https://youtu.be/uUuTYDg9XoI

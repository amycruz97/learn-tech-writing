# A Self-Study Plan to Learn Tech Writing

If you want to become a tech writer, you need to write tech docs! However, I know it's difficult to figure out how to get started, what you need to learn, and what resources to use. So I created this project-based self-study plan to help you: 

- Learn what's tech writing and the tech writing process
- Learn the common tech documents in the software industry (UI docs, user docs, developer docs)(documentation framework)
- Familiarize yourself with industry-standard style guides
- Create 4 tech writing portfolio samples
- Use GitHub and Markdown

Estimated time required: 4 weeks (1-2 hours per day)

If you are a curious about tech writing as a career or a new tech writer, this plan is for you.
